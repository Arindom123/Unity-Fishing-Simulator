# Unity-Fishing-Simulator
As part of a program at Carnegie Mellon University—the Summer Academy of Math and Science—I participated in a game development project class. Through Unity, I created Fishing Simulator, a robust program utilizing the C.A.V.E.R.N: a 270° stereoscopic multiplayer CAVE system. This game is designed to be played with a VIVE Tracker.
